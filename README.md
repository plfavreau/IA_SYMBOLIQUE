## üö¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY='your openai api key here'
```

Then run the containers with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build # first time
```

```bash
docker-compose up # next times
```

To stop the containers:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
